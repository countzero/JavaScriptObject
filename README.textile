h1. JavaScriptObject

JavaScriptObject is an application to publish 3D models in a userfriendly way. It does not require any applets, plugins or similar. JavaScriptObject works with every browser, that can handle images and supports JavaScript: And that is something almost 100% of all conventional graphical browsers can do.

The principle is simple: A 3D model is rotated by a given step width around two axes. An image of the model is rendered at each step. After a full revolution around both axes one has a "complete" frameset of the object. Finally the JavaScript shows a single frame out of the image pool in relation to the mouse position and thereby creates the illusion of an 3D object.

The advantage of this solution lies in the offline rendering of the frames which allows high image qualities. JavaScriptObject enables a cross-platform presentation of 3D content with minimal system requirements.
